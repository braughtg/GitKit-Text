If you would like you can review a discussion of some of these principles at The Open Source Way       Consider each of the following statements about the operation of a FOSS community and choose the principle (or principles if multiple apply equally) with which it most closely aligns.   By building on each other's work the community can solve problems that no one could solve alone.      shared values  collaboration  transparency    inclusivity  meritocracy  release early and often      Decisions and the rationale for them are available to the community.      shared values  collaboration  transparency    inclusivity  meritocracy  release early and often      The mission and goals of the community are more important than individual agendas.      shared values  collaboration  transparency    inclusivity  meritocracy  release early and often      The best ideas should win, regardless of where they come from.      shared values  collaboration  transparency    inclusivity  meritocracy  release early and often      Incorporating new changes and features quickly generates feedback and leads to rapid improvement.      shared values  collaboration  transparency    inclusivity  meritocracy  release early and often      Community members enhance and extend what others contribute in unanticipated ways.      shared values  collaboration  transparency    inclusivity  meritocracy  release early and often      Decision makers continually seek diverse perspectives.      shared values  collaboration  transparency    inclusivity  meritocracy  release early and often      All community members have access to the information necessary to do their best work.      shared values  collaboration  transparency    inclusivity  meritocracy  release early and often         FOSS Community Roles   There are a number of roles that tend to exist in FOSS communities.

  "title": "The Issue Tracker",
  "body": " The Issue Tracker   FOSS projects often use an issue tracker to maintain a list of bugs to be fixed, features to be added and other tasks to be completed. Thus, the issue tracker is a good place to go in order to find something to work on in a FOSS project. The exercises in this section will guide you through interaction with the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker as shown in . By the end of the section you will have found an issue to work on.    The GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker in GitHub.   The GitHub issue tracker displaying issues from the GitKit FarmData2 repository.       Exploring the Issue Tracker     The tasks in this exercise will help you to find the issue tracker for the GitKit FarmData2 repository that you will be using.   Visit the URL that your instructor provided for the GitKit FarmData2 repository that you will be using as the upstream repository for your course.   Click the \"Issues\" tab near the top of the page to go to the issue tracker. This will take you to a page similar to the one shown in .    Use the issue tracker in the GitKit FarmData2 repository to complete the following tasks.   Every issue has a number and a title. What is the title of issue #10?     Add Missing \"that\"      Seeding Report: Allows Invalid Inputs      Seeding Input: Duplicates appearing in Area Dropdown      Dickinson College Farm Link    Be sure you are looking at issue #10.

ONBOARDING.md    INSTALL.md    CONTRIBUTING.md    LICENSE.md   Be sure you are looking at issue #11.  Which of the following indicate an order by which the issues can be sorted?    Newest    Oldest    Recently updated    Most commented    Most difficult    Highest priority   Find the \"Sort\" drop-down in the issue tracker and see what \"Sort by\" options there are.  Pick one of the sort orders that can be used with issues and briefly explain why it might be useful to sort the issues in that order.  Think about why it might bue useful for a requestor, contributor or maintainer to find the types of issues that would be at the top of the sorted list.     Claiming an Issue   Because projects often have many people working asynchronously many will have a process by which contributors can claim an issue that they are interested in working on and have that issue assigned to them in the issue tracker.  The following exercises will guide you through the process of claiming an issue to work on in the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker.      Examine the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker. How can you tell which issue have already been assigned?    The avatar of the assigned user appears to the right of the issue title.    The issue no longer appears in the issue tracker.    The username of assigned user appears next to the issue title.    The issue is moved to a separate list of assigned issues.    The issue tracker does not show any indication that an issue has been assigned.   Look for some lines for issues that look different than the others and hover your mouse over the different parts.  In the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker, contributors interested in working on an issue can request that it be assigned to them by commenting on the issue with the exact message:   I would like to work on this please!   The first person who comments on an unclaimed issue with this message will receive a response from the project maintainers. This messages will indicate that the issue has been assigned to them and the issue tracker will update to show this as you saw in .   Use the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker to complete the following tasks.   Choose an unassigned issue with a \"Round 1\" tag.  See for information about identifying assigned and unassigned issues.  Comment on the issue that you chose using the message above to claim it.  Click on the issue title to open the issue and use the \"Add a comment\" box at the bottom of the page.  Reload the issue tracker and check that you received a response and that the issue has been assigned to you.   If you did not receive a response, wait a few minutes and reload the issue tracker page again. Sometimes it takes a few minutes for your comment to be noticed and the issue to be assigned. If you still do not receive a response check that you typed the message correctly.  If you received a response telling you that you were not assigned the issue, someone else slipped a comment in just ahead of you and was assigned the issue. If this happens, just try again.    Give the full URL to the issue that you have been assigned, for example https:\/\/github.com\/my-class\/GitKit-FarmData2\/issues\/2          Thank you.      Please give the full URL using the format indicated in the question.       It is worth noting that different projects will have different processes for claiming and assigning issues, and some projects may not assign issues at all. What are some advantages and disadvantages of assigning issues to specific individuals?  Think about this from both the individual developer's perspective and from the overall project's perspective.    "

In this step you will fork the main project repository, which creates a copy of it into your own GitHub space.    Forking the main project repository.   Creating a fork of the main project repo creates a copy of it in your own GitHub space. This copy is your remote copy.     Note that when working on the GitKit you will not actually be interacting with the main FarmData2 repository. Instead, you will be interacting with a copy of the FarmData2 repository that was created just for these activities. That said, you will be treating this copy exactly as if it is the “Main Project Repo” or the upstream repository. This allows you, your classmates and many other students to practice interacting with an upstream project for learning purposes without affecting the main FarmData2 repository.      Your instructor will have provided you with the URL of the GitKit FarmData2 repository that you will be using as the main project repo (i.e. the upstream) for the exercises in this text.

This is done by setting a remote for it. This exercise will walk you through that process.  The git remote -v command lists the names and URLs of all of the remote repositories (or just remotes for short) that your local repo knows about. Run this command in the directory that contains your local repository.   How is the origin remote indicated in represented in ?      CHOICE        CHOICE        CHOICE        CHOICE      ADD HINT HERE   To create a new remote that tells your local repo about the upstream you will need the URL of the upstream repo. Use your browser to navigate to the upstream FarmData2 repo that you are using for this course and give its URL here. Hint: You can find the upstream using the link from your origin repo in GitHub. Once you find the upstream, you can get the URL by using the “Code” button in the upstream repo, it ends in .git .   The git remote command can also be used to add a new remote to your local repo. The format for this command is:   git remote add <remote repo name> <remote repo URL>   Use the above command to create a remote named upstream that points to the FarmData2 upstream repository that you are using for this exercise.   Use the git remote -v command to confirm that the new upstream remote has been added.   The upstream remote provides your local repo with the information it needs to find the upstream repo. In git this information is represented using a URL. How is this information represented in ?      CHOICE        CHOICE        CHOICE        CHOICE      ADD HINT HERE   Note that you will only need to set the upstream remote once for a repository. Once the upstream remote is set you will be able to pull from the upstream repo as often as is necessary.   "
